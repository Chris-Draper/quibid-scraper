This text file features the research I had to do to make the web scraper work

Python - What is threading?
- Threading is used to run multiple tasks
- The tasks are not executed on different CPUs
- Will not make your program faster if you already use 100% CPU power
- Used when the execution of a task involves some level of waiting
- Threading allows python to execute other code while it is waiting

Python - What is multiprocessing?
- Uses subprocesses instead of threads
- Allows you to fully leverage multiple processors on a machine
- Side steps the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads
- The GIL makes it very effecient to do single processor tasks which are used the most
- "Locking the entire interpreter makes it easier for the interpreter to be multi-threaded
at the expense of much of the parallelism afforded by multi-processor machines"

Now I have an implementation of the program that I think works. How do I test that I grab the optimal number of auction links?
First, you need to track all of the auctions that come up on the website page in one program
In a separate program, track all of the auctions that you web scrape
See if the two programs match each other. If they do, then you know that you correctly scraped all of the auction data

Notes about sql data base implementation

Used a dope ORM called peewee and it was actually easy to use and awesome
Check the databases > python-databases > peewee folder to see everything

How to fix this error

OSError: [WinError 10048] Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted

First off, I read this basic info about the Windows Registry
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724946(v=vs.85).aspx

Follow the info on this link for step by step instructions on how to correctly change the registry values
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa560610(v=bts.20).aspx

Basically, go into the registery of the machine and change the socket range 
and how long your machine waits to reuse a socket to avoid running out of sockets

Connecting to the MySQL Database on "Host Department"

Setup up the database and a mysql user with all permissions
MAKE SURE TO ADD THE IP ADDRESSES OF YOUR COMPUTER TO THE REMOTE MYSQL IP ADDRESS LIST

 I also used this link to reset the ASUS computer so that I could use it as a bot to run the scrapers

It may be worth looking into running this program on Amazon Web Services once it is air tight and debugged

This talk about the boto library which is used to run python code on Amazon Servers
https://aws.amazon.com/articles/3998

And this is the pricing scheme for Amazon Web Services. It can work out to about $100 a year to rent a server for what you need
https://aws.amazon.com/emr/pricing/

Obviously you would have to do way more research into this, but if your ASUS i5 bites the dust this is the next option
